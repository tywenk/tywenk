I am an artist and software developer.

A few of my favorites quotes: 
* Gardening, not architecture. 
* Ethusiasm is worth 25 IQ points.
* Information wants to be free, and expensive.
* Time exists in order that everything doesnâ€™t happen all at onceâ€¦ and space exists so that it doesnâ€™t all happen to you.
